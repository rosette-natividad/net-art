    <h1>Your Average TikTok Comment Section: A Digital Intervention</h1>
    <p>This intervention took place on the TikTok platform in the comments section of user, 
        @StevenAtYourService, on his video captioned 
        "<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@stevenatyourservice/video/7339584119707274539">pov: junkrat in season 9</a>." 
        TikTok is a platform, similar to YouTube, where users can create videos for others to watch. They can follow, like, 
        comment, donate to content creators, and even shop. I chose my intervention to take place on this platform because 
        it is a very popular and prominent platform. I often see arguments happening in the comments section for even 
        the smallest things that are then blown up out of proportion. I tried to keep the argument light and took a more 
        passive aggressive route in a less political/controversial context to avoid the scary part of the digital world, 
        such as doxing, for my safety. Because of this I chose a video about a video game, Overwatch.
    </p> 
    <p>Below is the full argument I started with myself on the accounts star dog (@junkstarrz) and @minions4minions along with 
        their profiles. All other comments were made by other users. The initial argument was commented on Friday night 3/8/24. 
        It began to gain traction the next day with just a couple likes on the initial comment. Later that day some users began 
        to comment on the interaction. Some of the responses were as expected. I expected them to call out @minions4minions but 
        I never thought about the extremities in which they would do so. The last comment that was made by Ariela caught me off 
        guard. While defending star dog, they used some unique words to call out @minions4minions. Meanwhile, the other users were 
        a little bit nicer about it.
    </p>
    <p>If I had more time to expand on my intervention, I think I would have tried commenting on several other users' comments in 
        the same video as @minions4minions. I feel like that could have drawn a lot more attention. I think by doing so the 
        creator of the video may end up blocking me or users would become more interactive and vocal towards @minions4minions.

    <b>[Bridge: <em>Dominic Fike, Dominic Fike & Rivers Cuomo</em>]</b>
    <p>I hold my head, she sings to me <br>
    I grow, forget her in my work <br>
    Those times we shared, they're yours alone <br>
    And when I'm dead, we'll all go home <br>
    They'll cry, they'll sing, then leave this place <br>
    This place to me was everything <br>
    What hurts, what stings, I saw her in <br>
    The garden with her friends, she said</p>

    <b>[Pre-Chorus: <em>Dominic Fike</em>]</b>
    <ul>
        <li> I will find out,&nbsp;I will</li>
        <li>Wake up, find out,&nbsp;I will</li>
    </ul>

    <b>[Chorus: <em>Dominic Fike</em>]</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Think fast, you only get one try</li>
        <li>Sleep tight, I wanna get sunshine</li>
        <li>Wake up, you know we got things to see</li>
        <li>She talks and nothing makes sense to me</li>
    </ol>
